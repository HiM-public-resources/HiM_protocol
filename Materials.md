## Reagent setup

**PCR Oil phase** The mix final concentration is 95.95% mineral oil:4% ABIL EM-90:0.05% Triton X-100 oil phase (v/v/v). If available, with the use of a positive displacement pipette it is possible to directly pipette 2 mL of ABIL EM90, 65 µL of Triton X-100 and 47.975 mL of mineral oil to a 50-mL Falcon tube. Add the mineral oil in two steps, vortexing in between them. If positive displacement pipette is not available, volume can be accurately determined by weighing. To prepare 50 mL of PCR oil phase, weigh 20.3 g of mineral oil (around 24 mL) directly into a 50-mL Falcon tube, add 2 mL of ABIL EM90 and 65 µL of Triton X-100, vortex thoroughly and leave it rest for 5 min. Then add 20 g of mineral oil and homogenize by inversion of the tube. Make 20 mL aliquots of PCR Oil phase and store indefinitely at 4 °C.

**1 M NaOH solution** Weigh 2 g of NaOH and mix it with 30 mL ddH2O in a 50-mL Falcon tube and dissolve. Complete to 50 mL and pass it through a 0.22 µm filter. The solution can be stored at room temperature (RT, ~23 °C) for several months.

**0.5 M EDTA solution** To prepare 200 mL, weigh 37.23 g of EDTA and mix it with 150 mL of ddH2O in a glass beaker. Add a magnetic stirring bar and stir while adjusting to pH 8 with NaOH 10 M. Add ddH2O up to 200 mL. Filter solution with a 0.22 µm filter. The solution can be stored at 4 °C for several months. CRITICAL: EDTA will not dissolve until pH approaches to 8. Verify the final solution as pH may decrease when EDTA is dissolved.

**RNA Hybridization solution (RHS)** To prepare 250 mL of RHS, mix 125 mL of formamide, 62.5 mL of 20X SSC, 1.25 mL of 10 mg/mL heparin, 2.5 mL 10% Tween-20 (v/v), 2.5 mL of 10 mg/mL of salmon sperm and 56.5 mL ddH2O. Prepare 50 mL aliquots and stock at -20 °C for several months.

**RNA probe preparation** Put 2 µL of RNA probe in 250 µL of RHS, incubate at 85 °C on a dry bath incubator for 2.5 min. Then incubate on ice for at least two minutes before adding it to the embryos. CRITICAL: Freshly prepare the RNA probe, keeping it on ice no more than an hour before its use. Check the temperature of the dry bath to avoid probe degradation. Do not exceed 2.5 min incubation as high temperature might degrade the probe.

Complete to 50 mL with ddH2O, and pass it through a 0.22 µm filter. The solution can be stored at RT for several months. 

**55 mM NaCl in 11 mM Tris-HCl pH=8 solution** To prepare 50 mL of this solution, mix 2.75 mL of 1M NaCl solution, 0.55 mL of 1M Tris-HCl pH=8 solution, and 46.7 mL of ddH2O. Prepare freshly.

**Gloxy solution** To prepare 1 mL of Gloxy solution, mix 50 mg Glucose oxidase, 100 µL catalase and 900 µL of 55 mM NaCl in 11 mM Tris-HCl pH=8. CRITICAL: Make 60 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C. Solution is stable for several months. Defrost on the day of the experiment and keep it on ice until use. If there is a precipitate, spin it down and employ the supernatant. Once defrozen, the aliquot should be used within one week. 

**Hi-M wash buffer** To prepare 100 mL, combine 10 mL of 20X SSC, 40 mL of formamide and make up to 100 mL with ddH2O (Final concentration of 40% v/v formamide). CRITICAL: Freshly prepare formamide containing solutions and pass them through a 0.22 µm filter.

**Hi-M acquisition solution** To prepare 10 mL of solution, combine 1.1 mL of 50% (w/v) glucose with 9.9 mL of PBS and 110 µL of Gloxy. CRITICAL: Add Gloxy solution just before using the solution and mix. Once the tubing is introduced, add a layer of mineral oil to prevent contact with oxygen from the ambient. Replace after 12-15 h.

**Readout probe solution** The final composition of this solution is 25 nM of the corresponding readout oligo in 40% (v/v) formamide 2X SSC. Readout oligos sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 1. CRITICAL: Prepare freshly and keep it protected from light.

**Chemical bleaching solution** To prepare 10 mL of chemical bleaching solution, mix one 1-mL ampule of TCEP with 9 mL of 2X SSC. CRITICAL: Prepare the solution right before its use and discard any remaining solution.

**Wide-field epifluorescence microscope** A modular microscope system (RAMM, Applied Scientific Instrument) equipped with a 60x water-immersion objective (Plan-achromat NA=1.2, Nikon) and a sCMOS camera (Orca Flash 4.0v3, Hamamatsu) is used for Hi-M imaging. With this objective/tube lens combination, we obtained a 108 nm pixel size, leading to a ~220x220 µm field of view. Sample displacement and embryo selection are performed using a 2-axis translation stage (MS2000, Applied Scientific Instrumentation). Wide-field epifluorescence illumination is achieved using 405/488/561 and 641 nm lasers (OBIS-405/488/640 and Sapphire 561 - Coherent) combined with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTFnC-400.650, AA opto-electronics). To avoid the use of a mechanical filter-wheel, separation between excitation and emission light is done using a four-band dichroic mirror (zt405/488/561/640rpc-UF2, Chroma) combined with a four-band emission filter (ZET405/488/561/640m, Chroma). Finally, the objective lens is mounted on a single-axis piezo-stage (Nano-F100, Mad City Labs Inc.), allowing for a nm-precision control of the objective axial position during z-scan and focus stabilization. 	A home-made focus stabilization system was used to compensate the axial drift in real-time. A 785 nm laser beam (OBIS-785, Coherent) is focused on the back-focal plane of the objective, reaching the coverslip/sample interface in near-TIRF illumination conditions. The position of the reflected beam is then measured on a position-sensitive detector (OBP-A-4H, Newport) and any variation in the objective-sample distance above 100 nm is automatically compensated by repositioning the objective lens.

**Hi-M sequential hybridization:** Design for fluid handling circuits was implemented as described in Cardozo Gizzi et al[(Cardozo Gizzi et al. 2019)](https://paperpile.com/c/gKp8rW/jdOpb). The sample is mounted in a FCS2 chamber and flow is created using a negative pressure pump. An online flow-unit is used to continuously monitor flow-rate, allowing for a precise control of injected volumes as well as for maintaining a steady flow in the chamber. Buffers and probes are selected using a combination of three eight-way HVXM8-5 valves. Finally, an online degassing unit is inserted before the fluidic chamber to avoid air-bubble nucleation during Hi-M experiments.

**User/microscope interface:** Image acquisition, sample positioning and liquid handling are controlled by a custom-made software package developed in LabView 2015.
